            <h1>Island with Full Tummies</h1>
            <p>The <strong>Island with Full Tummies</strong> project is designed to address food scarcity in isolated and hard-to-reach island communities. 
            Many island populations suffer from limited food access due to transportation challenges, high costs, and environmental factors. 
            This project aims to create a reliable food supply system using sustainable agriculture, local fisheries, and community-driven distribution networks.</p>
        <h3>Key Features:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Sustainable Food Production:</strong> Encourages islanders to grow their own food using hydroponics, vertical farming, and local fisheries.</li>
            <li><strong>Strategic Food Supply Chains:</strong> Establishes partnerships with mainland food suppliers to ensure steady deliveries of essential items.</li>
            <li><strong>Emergency Food Aid:</strong> Provides nutritional support during natural disasters, storms, and economic crises.</li>
            <li><strong>Education & Awareness:</strong> Conducts workshops on nutrition, food preservation, and sustainable farming to enhance community resilience.</li>
        </ul>
            <h3>Objectives:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Promote Local Food Sources:</strong> Support islanders in growing crops using sustainable farming techniques such as hydroponics and aquaponics.</li>
            <li><strong>Improve Supply Chains:</strong> Establish reliable food transportation routes and storage facilities to reduce food spoilage.</li>
            <li><strong>Emergency Food Assistance:</strong> Provide disaster relief packages with essential food supplies during hurricanes, tsunamis, and other crises.</li>
            <li><strong>Education & Awareness:</strong> Conduct workshops on nutrition, food safety, and efficient farming practices.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Impact:</h3>
        <p>More than <strong>25 island communities</strong> have benefited from this initiative, leading to a <strong>40% increase</strong> in local food production and a significant reduction in dependency on external food sources.</p>
